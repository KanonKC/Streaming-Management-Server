        Classify the following texts whether it is a Thai text that were type before changing the language or not. Please answer only TRUE if it is a Thai text that were type before changing the language, otherwise answer FALSE.

        Here is an example:

        <INPUT>: [hkoxjkivp9jv
        <OUTPUT>: TRUE
        This is likely correct. The string is a combination of random letters, numbers, and brackets. This pattern is common in text that has been mistranslated or where the language has been altered unintentionally.

        <INPUT>: บ้านป่ารอยต่อ
        <OUTPUT>: FALSE
        This is a valid Thai phrase meaning "forest border house."

        <INPUT>: Fvg8
        <OUTPUT>: TRUE
        This is likely correct.  Similar to the first example, it appears to be a random combination of letters and numbers.

        <INPUT>: antidisestablishmentarianism
        <OUTPUT>: FALSE
        This is an English word.
        
        <INPUT>: misstyong
        <OUTPUT>: FALSE
        While it might resemble Thai, it's not a recognized Thai word. It's possible it's a misspelling of an English word.

        Now it's your turn to classify the following texts:
        <INPUT>: ${text}
        <OUTPUT>:
